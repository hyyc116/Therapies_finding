### Diseases-Scales-Therapies Network
This directory mainly includes the codes of DSTN based therapy finding.
 
### Prerequisites

	[CHUNK PARSER](https://github.com/biplab-iitb/practNLPTools) 



#### 1. Fetch stroke related papers from PubMed with Crawler. 
	Data file named as stroke.txt in which one record one line, line format is pmid \t abstract.
#### 2. Extract all NPs by using np_extractor.py. 
	python np_extractor.py saved_NPs.txt stroke_abs.txt 1>>saved_NPs.txt 2>run.log 
#### 3. Identify scales and therapies from NPs extracted. 
	python therapy_filter.py saved_NPs.txt > stroke_therapy.txt 
	python scale_filter.py saved_NPs.txt > stroke_scale.txt
#### 4. Domain expert checking, filter out error items.
	The results are labeled as "KNOWN_SCALES" and "KNOWN_THERAPIES".

#### 5. Fetch articles of all scales in KNOWN_SCALES.
	File is named as scales.txt in which one record one line, line format is pmid \t abstract.

#### 6. Extract all possible therapies from crawled scales data.
	python np_extractor.py scale_NPs.txt stroke_abs.txt 1>>scale_NPs.txt 2>run.log 
	python therapy_filter.py scale_NPs.txt > scale_therapy.txt 

#### 7. Filter out therapies already in KNOWN_TERAPIES and got a collection NEW_THERAPIES and the intermediate SCALE name between new therapy and stroke.
In this step, we could use the therapies in stroke_therapy.txt as KNOWN_THERAPIES to filter the result. 

	python scale_new_therapy_linking.py stroke_therapy.txt stroke_scale.txt scale_therapy.txt scale_NPs.txt > test_new_therapy_links.txt 


#### 8. Human Checking and get the final result.
	Although, we have got a result, but due to the precision in therapy extraction,  
	there are still some nosies in the NEW_THERAPIES which will be filtered out by human checking.
